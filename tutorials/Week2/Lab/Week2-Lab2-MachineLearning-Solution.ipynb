Both these algorithms are implemented in  linear_model.LogisticRegression and svm.LinearSVC respectively.\n","\n","In logistic regression, we take the output of the linear function and squash the value within the range of [0,1] using the sigmoid function( logistic function). The Sigmoid-Function is an S-shaped curve that can take any real-valued number and map it into a value between the range of 0 and 1, but never exactly at those limits. Typically, if the squashed value is greater than a threshold value we assign it a label 1, else we assign it a label 0.
