Logistic Regression\n","\n","**Goal:** Given a binary classification problem, the goal to fit the best line to the training data and have a maximum probability of classifying unseen data. \n","\n","There are two most common algorithms for  classification namely Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Both these algorithms are implemented in  linear_model.LogisticRegression and svm.LinearSVC respectively. \n","\n","In logistic regression, we take the output of the linear function and squash the value within the range of [0,1] using the sigmoid function( logistic function). The Sigmoid-Function is an S-shaped curve that can take any real-valued number and map it into a value between the range of 0 and 1, but never exactly at those limits. Typically, if the squashed value is greater than a threshold value we assign it a label 1, else we assign it a label 0. This justifies the name ‘logistic regression’.\n","Note that the difference between logistic and linear regression is that Logistic regression gives you a discrete outcome but linear regression gives a continuous outcome.\n","\n","**Note:** Logistic regression is a classification algorithm and it should not be confused with Linear regression.\n","\n","**Reference**: https://towardsdatascience.com/support-vector-machine-vs-logistic-regression-94cc2975433f\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["## Import the library for Logistic Regression and Linear SVM\n","from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n","from sklearn.svm import LinearSVC\n","from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer"],"metadata":{"id":"c5xFaK1C8DbH"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"H-f2HI03WXOz"},"source":["### Example-1: Train and test a Logistic regression on Breast Cancer Dataset"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"7FXbv81liRcd"},"source":["## Apply Logistic Regression on Breast Cancer Dataset\n","## 1.
